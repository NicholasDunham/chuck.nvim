chuck.vim
=========

A vim plugin for [ChucK](http://chuck.stanford.edu/), a programming language for
real-time sound synthesis and music creation.

This is a work in progress! The main goal is to support managing the ChucK VM
and starting/stopping shreds from vim.


insallation
-----------

This plugin is [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) and
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/) compatible. The simplest way
to get it installed is to use one of those.

Or you can also copy the files manually to their corresponding directories in
your `~/.vim/` directory if you're into the taste of awfulness.
